This Python script implements the Vigen√®re Cipher, which works as follows:

- The key is a keyword, which is translated into corresponding letter values 0 - 25.
- To encrypt a message, the message is written on one row (letters 0 - 25), and the keyword is repeatedly written below it, adding each column, taking the result mod 26. These resultant numbers are the ciphertext.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system.

### Usage

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script 

4. Follow the instructions provided by the script to input the plaintext and the keyword.

5. The script will output the ciphertext.
